            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            
            <p>Curtain Call Dance</p>
            
            <p>This company, Curtain Call Dance, is a dance studio that will offer an array of dance styles for different ages and levels.</p>
            
            <h2>Target audience</h2>
            
            <p>The target audience for this website will be parents and supporters of children in the local area who are interested in getting their children involved in a dance program or enroll in dance classes.</p>
           
            <p>The primary goal of the user is to gain more knowledge and information about our studio. This would include the types of classes we offer and the different levels and age ranges. They would also want to know prices and price packages for lessons as well as different opportunities we might provide such as summer intensives, recitals, competition teams or connections to professional dance companies or dance schools. First time users will probably compare our website in making a decision over wether or not to enroll. Returning or regular users will know how to navigate the website very easily and will want to be made aware of any changes or updates.</p>
            
            <p>Another Task of the website would be for parents to actually be able to register their students for classes on the website and pay online. There would also be a visible calendar so parents know which classes happen when and are aware of upcoming events.</p>
